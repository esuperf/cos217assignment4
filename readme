Student 2: What is your name?

Student 1: What authorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of
information given in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab
in the file ~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the
readme file, and edit it as appropriate.

You may consult the course's lectures, precepts, website, textbooks and manuals (including the man pages from the armlab cluster). These sources should be acknowledged in your readme file, but do not have to be cited specifically (e.g., with a page number or URL) unless copied verbatim.
Yep referenced these

You may consult with the course's instructors in class, in office hours, in separate meetings, and on Ed. You may consult with your own preceptor via email. These sources should be acknowledged by name in your readme file.
Nope

You may consult with the McGraw tutors for conceptual help about course topics (but not assignment-specific details) and with the COS Intro LabTAs for debugging help (but not general conceptual issues). These sources should be acknowledged by name in your readme file.
Many many hours spent at Cos Lab hours
Ruoming - helped me figure out how to even start part 2
Max & Santiago - managed to mess up so egregiously that neither I nor they by themselves
could figure out what was even wrong with my code (I was compiling it wrong)
Ayush - Once again messed up part 2 egregiously Ayush helped me identify and fix why
the directories decided to give up printing when tested (my counter variable was apparently the problem)
give that man a raise
Phu - Helped with bugs for insertFile and toString
Taylor - helped me realize what i was doing wrong with meminfo

You may consult with peers taking the course (or those who took the course in a prior semester) only about conceptual topics. Specifically, this means you may not discuss assignment-specific details in any form: code, code comments, pseudo-code, flow charts, outlines, diagrams, natural language prose descriptions of any of the above, etc. This applies to any medium: verbally, in writing or email or texting or messaging, and on social media including a course groupchat or Discord or our course's Ed Discussion.
Nope

You may not search the web for solutions (whether full or partial solutions to the programming assignments or to related problems) or hints for solving the course assignments. It is permissible to search the web for conceptual assistance on course topics not in any way specific to the assignment, but in the past we have found students are often led astray by such queries — developing bad habits or even factual misconceptions — so we'd strongly prefer that you use the extensive set of material and personal resources from within the course.
Searched explanation for gdb

You may consult with a Large Language Model or other Generative AI for assistance with conceptual topics for the class and for help with the assignments, subject to the full Generative AI policy below. Note that we would not be surprised if you were similarly led astray by LLM responses as students have been with Google searches, but this is an open question for this semester's policies.
Searched explanation for gdb

You may not provide any help that would be a violation to receive based on these policies.
Nope

Student 2: What authorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of
information given in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab
in the file ~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the
readme file, and edit it as appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

Asked AI how to apply gdb for part 1 because this was when there were no available
office hours because for some reason I did not comprehend that you could gdb
the source files as well as the main file. Still probably did it wrong

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

Didn't even get to test part 3; it's probably all wrong and doesn't
work but I tried, man. Can't even tell you what bugs are in it.
It's probably all bugs.

What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

checkerDT.c: line 86: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'counter' through an assert?
don't particularly want to because it doesn't matter if it's NULL

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
       ./bdtBad1     BDT_insert
---------------------------------------------------------------
     ./bdtBad2     fails @ !strcmp(temp,"a\na/x\n");
     -> problem with the insert function
---------------------------------------------------------------
     ./bdtBad3    BDT_contains
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4    BDT_strlenAccumulate
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5     BDT_contains   
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

- Inconsistant parameter order in nodeDT - new has Path before Parent
while hasChild has Parent before Path
- Neither DT_rm or DT_destroy free the memory after they remove or destroy 
parts of the there
- DT_findNode and DT_traversePath static functions can probably
be combined
